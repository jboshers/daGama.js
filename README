DaGama.js is a neat navigation plugin for jQuery that allows you to make those sliding pages that is all the rage now. Great for plugin documentation pages such as these, your portfolio, or even your grandmother's garden club's website. Currently, it only supports vertical scrolling. Horizontal scrolling will be along very shortly.
